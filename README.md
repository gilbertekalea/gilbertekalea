- 👋 Hi, I’m Ekaale
- 👀 I’m interested in Web development, web scraping, data analysis and technology stuffwise. I have a background in Business Information systems but I love the art of coding. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python flask and it's application in web development. 
- Currently working on personal project called sporty-a web application to connect local players to local teams for recreational sports. 
- I like to talk about soccer, open data access, and technology accessibility. In my free time, I like to do photography; walk around the city with my drone(dji mini) and canon eos). 
- 💞️ If you're starting out as a programmer, feel free to reach out to me. I am also starting out and there is no one perfect.
- All I care is to make the world a better place for everyone regardless of economic status.
